> github-archive is a simple tool that backs up every repository and branch for a specified user.

## Use

Run ```github-archive``` followed by the auth token of the user and the account name (or organizational account name).

For your convenience you can create a specific backup user (say BackupAgent) who is allowed to browse any repository you want to back up.

To get an auth token for this user, logs into its GitHub account, go into Settings, Personal access tokens, then Generate new token. Please store your token safely.

## Example

```
github-archive 5a1a2393ca99685410fcd71e6e915232cb4fe21a YourOrganizationName
```

Everything will be backed up under the ```data``` folder.

## Why backup a GitHub repository

In case something happens to GitHub. More generally because keeping your data in the cloud and relying on the cloud to back it up is foolish.
